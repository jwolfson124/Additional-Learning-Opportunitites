# Additional-Learning-Opportunitites
Python Libraries To take classes on:
1. Pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. scipy
6. sklearn
7. Folium
8. Pycharm - by jet brains
9. Snap Machine Learning by IBM

Stats to learn or remember:
1. F-test Score
2. P-Value
3. Correlation 1 vs -1
4. R-Squared
5. Mean Squared Error
6. Cross Value
7. Underfitting vs Overfitting
8. Ridge Regression
9. Standard Scalar vs Normalization
    - Standard Scalar alters the data so that the data has a more reaonsable distribution
    - Normalization makes the values between 0-1
10. Support Vector Machine
    - Helps find the best stratification and uses lines that may be curved or straight
11. Rociever Operating Characteristics
    - Evaluate performance of a binary classification model
    - Closer to 1 the better
12. Entropy
    -Calculating the purity or impurtiy of a decision tree
    -A value of 0 is perfect and a value of 1 means that the dataset is completley equal -> not what you want in a decision tree
13. Regression Tree
    - A mix of a decision tree and regression analysis
