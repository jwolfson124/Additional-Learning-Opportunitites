# Additional-Learning-Opportunitites
Python Libraries To take classes on:
1. Pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. scipy
6. sklearn
7. Folium
8. Pycharm - by jet brains
9. Snap Machine Learning by IBM

Stats to learn or remember:
1. F-test Score
2. P-Value
3. Correlation 1 vs -1
4. R-Squared
5. Mean Squared Error
6. Cross Value
7. Underfitting vs Overfitting
8. Ridge Regression
9. Standard Scalar vs Normalization
    - Standard Scalar alters the data so that the data has a more reaonsable distribution
    - Normalization makes the values between 0-1
10. Support Vector Machine
    - Helps find the best stratification and uses lines that may be curved or straight
    - Supervised algorythm by finding a seperator
    - Works by mapping data and finding something that splits the data
    - Con: Prone to overiftting if and not great for estimation
    - Pro: Memory efficient and accurate in high dimensional spaces
    - Uses: Image recognition, text category assignments such as detecting spam, gene expression classification, regression, outlier detection, clustering
11. Rociever Operating Characteristics
    - Evaluate performance of a binary classification model
    - Closer to 1 the better
12. Entropy
    -Calculating the purity or impurtiy of a decision tree
    -A value of 0 is perfect and a value of 1 means that the dataset is completley equal -> not what you want in a decision tree
14. Regression Tree
    - A mix of a decision tree and regression analysis
15. Logistic Regression
    - Predict a binary or multiclass variable instead of something that is continuos
    - Independent variables should be continous or if categorical should be transformed to numerical
    - jaccard index measures how many items are shared between the different data sets and is used to compare different sets
16. Logarimethic Loss
    - Measures how accurate a model is
    - Used only for binary case as of now a lower log loss is better
    - uses probability of prediction for the scores
17. Transform standard scaler and fit
    - this is useful for machine learning algorythms as this makes sure that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1
18. F1 Score
    - Used to assess the accuracy of a binary or multi classification model like logistic regression, support vector machines, or decision trees
    - Great for imbalanced datasets
    - Tracks Precision and Recall aka true positive vs false positive and true negative vs false negative
    - Close to 1 indicates good performance vs Close to 0 indicates poor performance
19. Clustering
    - A group of objects that are similar to other objects in the cluster and dissimilar to data points in other clusters unsupervised
    - Classification predict uses SVM, decision trees, or logistic regression for a new or known customer, each training data instance belongs to a class vs clustering is unsupervised and would use k-means for example to add them to a cluster based on similar attributes
    - Simply put clustering algorithms dont predict categorical class lables
